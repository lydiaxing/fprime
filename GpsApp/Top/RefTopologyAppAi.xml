Topology Ai:

The topology Ai.xml file consists of three parts:

1. Importation of individual modules and components
2. Declaration of used components
3. Port connections between components

Note: in most cases this file is auto-generated using magic draw.

Connection definitions:

This section defines the connections between components. The source component, and source component port name
should be declared, and matched to the target component, and port. The type of the port is also specified.
Finally, the port number on the source and target is defined, in the case that the named port has a multiplicity
meaning that it is an array of ports under the same name.
